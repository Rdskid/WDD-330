    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>This week was a great week to be able to refresh some of the basics of calculations and other such common uses of functions inside Javascript, I don't think I have truly practiced them since a year or two ago.</li>
        <li>Loops are very powerful tools and can be used in many different ways, rather than just as a counting system, but as a way to hold and maintain information and write to differnt functions.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>EX:<br />
                for (i = 0; i <= 5; i++) {<br/>
                    x = x + 1;<br />
                    console.log(x);<br / >

                }<br />
                This shows a loop that will continue to output and count to the number 5. Once i = 5 it will stop the loop and display it as the last one.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Arrays are just as powerful and can hold all types of information in one simple variable that is able to hold and maintain all the information that can be used throughout out to many different functions.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>EX <br/>
                let array = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Arrays will always start with the first item as number 0.</li>
    </ul>
