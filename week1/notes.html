    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <p>Not much for the notes this week, I am extremely excited to work in this class and hope that I can come to have a greater understanding of JavaScript, I struggled a lot with it last semester in WDD 230.</p>
    <h2>Reading specifics</h2>
    <p>Haven't done to much input saving, so this was a nice refresher to go along with it.</p>
