        <b>Three Types of Errors</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices
            with which the program is interacting.
          </li>

          <li>
            Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty
            logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.
          </li>

          <li>
            User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the
            program is unable to handle.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Best place for debugging code, the art of finding where bugs are in the
        code to be able to correct them, is in the browser.
      </li>
      <li>
        The debugger statement stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if
        available) the debugging function. Using the debugger statement has the
        same function as setting a breakpoint in the code.
