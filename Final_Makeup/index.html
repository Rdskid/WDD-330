      This took me longer than expected, but all in all I spent almost 30 work
      hours trying to get it complete and working properly. This was an amazing
      experience and would highly recommend addidng it to the regular course as
      it brought a greater understanding of everything. I wasn't sure what to
      add functional wise to the dev tools and event capture. The Ajax I wanted
      to add google maps but I couldn't seem to figure it out and get it to run
      a search for the location based on the lat and long of the JSON
